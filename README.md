## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

For Installation:

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MitchBrown532/crud-app.git
   cd crud-app
   ```
2. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```
3. Setup backend:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

For Concurrent Start-Up:

1. Run the start command:
   ```bash
   npm run start:all
   ```

- This command will concurrently run frontend & backend (including intializing the venv for backend). All data from frontend and backend will be color coded and shown in a shared console for ease of life.

For Front-end Start-up:

1. Navigate to frontend
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Run start-up command:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

For Back-end Start-up:

1. Navigate to frontend
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Start up Virtual Environment (if not already done)
   ```bash
   ./venv/Scripts/Activate
   ```
3. Run start-up command:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
